#Design-and-Implementation-of-Signal-Reconstruction-Method-Based-on-Compressed-Sensing
The traditional Nyquist law requires that the sampling frequency of the signal is much greater than twice the maximum frequency of the signal, which will bring challenges to hardware or software, and will also cause a waste of frequency. In compressed sensing theory, if the signal is sparse enough,  Then the signal can be accurately reconstructed with a frequency much smaller than the Nyquist frequency.
